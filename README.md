**Q:** Why was the repository moved?  
**A:** We moved the repository to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), as Microsoft has acquired GitHub.  
Microsoft is a nefarious entity with a long and consistent history of [unconscionable behaviour](https://jacquesmattheij.com/what-is-wrong-with-microsoft-buying-github).  
In other words, Microsoft can and will screw you over if its shareholders stand to benefit in the short/medium term.
